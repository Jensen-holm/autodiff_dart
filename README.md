# autodiff_dart

automatic differentiation library for Dart!

inspired by [Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), I thought that building this would be a good experience for me to learn dart, and deepen my understanding of backpropagation.

This package would be useful as a flutter package in a calculator application where you want the ability to calculate derivatives of functions that users write.
